          <h2>Hello! I'm a Software Developer</h2>
          <p>
            I'm passionate about creating elegant solutions to complex problems.
            With a strong foundation in both frontend and backend technologies,
            I enjoy building applications that make a difference.

          <h3>What I Do</h3>
          <p>
            I specialize in web development, with a focus on creating responsive,
            user-friendly applications. I'm always exploring new technologies and
            best practices to improve my craft.

          <h3>Outside of Work</h3>
          <p>
            When I'm not coding, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects,
            attending tech meetups, and staying up-to-date with the latest
            industry trends.
